# Progetto_RT
This collection of file is the result of my project, developed in order to pass the 
Real Time Embedded System exam.

Application goal:

Goal of this application is to simulate, in industrial scope, the behavior of a tank
that want to maintain your own liquid at a certain level according with a proximity sensor
located on top of tank.

The tank has a button, controlled by graphical interface, that allow to open a tap 
so to empty the tank.

When tank's level goes beyond the minimum desiderated a filler task is activate automatically.
